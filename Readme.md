#Agenda
Today we are taking our javascript to the next level. We are going to dive into javascript for the web. It’s a huge, ambitious day, with an enormous amount of content at a lightning pace. We think you’ll handle it. We expect that you’ll get confused and miss some things too. That’s okay!
In particular we’ll cover:
+ How to link to javascript libraries
+ How to use jquery to manipulate elements
+ How to animate elements with javascript
+ How to tell the browser to listen for and respond to events
+ How to get data from the user with html forms
